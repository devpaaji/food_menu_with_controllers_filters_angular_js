# food_menu_with_controllers_filters_angular_js
App will display different cuisine types on page load. I have used controllers to store JSON object. In the view, used ng-repeat to display the content. In addition, used a drop down menu to change or hide display items based on user select - using simple filter option on ng-repeat
